Content: 

* Preprocessing of the CDP (<a href="https://www.cdp.net/en">Climate Disclosure Panel</a>) GHG datasets (focused on 2016-2017)
* NLP (i.e. Natural Language Processing): Analysis of reasons for decreases/increases in emissions reported by cities
* Multiple Linear Regression: modeling the total emissions of cities (i.e. identification of significant features relevant in the description of total emissions of cities)
* Classification models (i.e. logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbour,
gaussian naive bayes, gradient boosting, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine clasifier): predicting the decrease or increase in emissions of cities
* GUI: vizualisation of the NLP results (barplot and bigrams network plot) - freely available at: https://mda-somalia.herokuapp.com/



NB: be gentle with the GUI, it is an online app hosted on a website.
